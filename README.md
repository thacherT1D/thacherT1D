### Hello World üåç

Hi! I'm Thacher (she/her). 

I am a frontend developer and UX designer, working mostly in React.

I'm currently open for work as a Frontend/UX Engineer. I just wrapped up working as a Frontend/UX Engineer at [Tidepool](http://www.tidepool.org).  For more information about my experience you can checkout my [LinkedIn Profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/thacherhussain) or [thacher.co](http://www.thacher.co)

I'm also available as a mentor on [mentorcruise.com](https://mentorcruise.com/mentor/ThacherHussain/), and previously worked as an instructor at [Galvanize](https://www.galvanize.com/web-development) for the Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp.

You can reach me on Twitter [@thacherhussain](http://www.twitter.com/thacherhussain) or by email at [thacher.hussain@gmail.com](mailto:thacher.hussain@gmail.com)

Ask me about... learning React, testing, reafactoring and upgrading applications, going to/graduating from a software development bootcamp, working in the healthcare industry, diabetes technology, coffee, or my adorable tripod dog
